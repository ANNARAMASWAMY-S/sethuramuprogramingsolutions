Understanding Recursive Algorithms
Recursion is a technique where a method calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It helps break complex problems into simpler sub-problems.
For example, calculating factorial(n) as:

int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

In forecasting, recursion can be used to compute future values if each value depends on the previous ones (like compound growth).
